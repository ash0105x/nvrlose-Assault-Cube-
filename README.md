# nvrlose (Assault Cube)

This project is an internal cheat designed for the game Assault Cube version 1.2.0.2, equipped with several features tailored to enhance gameplay. It's a part of my journey in game hacking and reverse engineering.

# Features

    Aimbot: Enhance accuracy and precision in targeting.
    ESP (Extra Sensory Perception): Visualize game information like player positions, health, and more.
    Hitmarker: Indicate hits to provide feedback on successful shots.
    Damage Multiplicator: Amplify damage output for more effective gameplay.
    Snaplines: Connect entities visually for improved awareness.
    Unlimited Ammo and Health: Maintain an advantage by never running out of ammo or health.

Please note that the user interface might resemble the default ImGui theme as I focused more on functionality rather than UI design.

    Open the .sln file in Visual Studio.
    Set the configuration to x86.
